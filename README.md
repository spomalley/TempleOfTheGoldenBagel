Temple of the Golden Bagel is an ancient Egypt themed Riddle Game which I developed when I originally learnt HTML. It is
on here to host a project to have it converted to PHP and integrated in JiGS in ascociation with Coderdojo Galway (coderdojogalway.com). 
JiGs is available at www.github.com/Techbot/JIGS
